# Vector Addition Experiment Documentation

## Overview
This experiment demonstrates basic vector addition on both CPU and GPU, showcasing the fundamental concepts of parallel computing and GPU acceleration.

## Purpose
- Demonstrate basic parallel computing concepts
- Compare CPU and GPU performance for vector operations
- Showcase CUDA programming basics

## Technical Details
- Implements vector addition: C = A + B
- Vector size: N elements
- CPU implementation uses sequential processing
- GPU implementation uses parallel processing with CUDA

## Performance Characteristics
- CPU version processes elements sequentially
- GPU version processes elements in parallel
- GPU typically shows better performance for large vector sizes (N > 1000)
- Performance improvement depends on:
  - Vector size
  - GPU architecture
  - Memory bandwidth

## Implementation Notes
- CPU version: Standard C++ implementation
- GPU version: CUDA implementation with:
