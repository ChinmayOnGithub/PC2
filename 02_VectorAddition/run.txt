# ===== EXPLANATION =====
# Vector Addition Program
# This program demonstrates basic vector addition on CPU and GPU
# The program adds two vectors of size N and stores the result in a third vector
# The GPU version typically runs faster for large vector sizes
# due to parallel processing capabilities of the GPU

# ===== EXECUTION COMMANDS =====
# GPU Version (CUDA)
# Compile the CUDA program
nvcc -o vectorAdditionGPU vectorAdditionGPU.cu

# Run the GPU version
./vectorAdditionGPU

# CPU Version
# Compile the C++ program
g++ -o vectorAdditionCPU vectorAdditionCPU.cpp

# Run the CPU version
./vectorAdditionCPU

# Note: The GPU version typically runs faster for large vector sizes
# due to parallel processing capabilities of the GPU
