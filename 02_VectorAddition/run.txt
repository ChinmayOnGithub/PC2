# ===== EXPLANATION =====
# Vector Addition Program
# This program demonstrates basic vector addition on CPU and GPU
# The program adds two vectors of size N and stores the result in a third vector
# The GPU version typically runs faster for large vector sizes
# due to parallel processing capabilities of the GPU

# ===== EXECUTION COMMANDS =====
# GPU Version
nvcc -O3 -o vectorAdditionGPU vectorAdditionGPU.cu
./vectorAdditionGPU

# CPU Version
g++ -O3 -o vectorAdditionCPU vectorAdditionCPU.cpp
./vectorAdditionCPU

# OpenACC Version
pgc++ -acc -ta=tesla:managed -fast vectorAdditionGPU_acc.cpp -o vectorAdditionGPU_acc
./vectorAdditionGPU_acc

# Alternative OpenACC Version
g++ -O3 -fopenacc -o vectorAdditionGPU_acc vectorAdditionGPU_acc.cpp
./vectorAdditionGPU_acc

# Note: The GPU version typically runs faster for large vector sizes
# due to parallel processing capabilities of the GPU
