# ===== EXPLANATION =====
# LUP Decomposition Program
# This program performs LUP decomposition (matrix factorization)
# Implements CPU, CUDA, and OpenACC versions
# LUP decomposition is used for solving systems of linear equations
# and matrix inversion. Different implementations show varying performance
# characteristics based on matrix size and hardware capabilities.

# ===== EXECUTION COMMANDS =====
# GPU Version
nvcc -O3 -o cuda_lu lup_cuda.cu
./cuda_lu

# CPU Version
g++ -O3 -o cpu_lu lup_cpu.cpp
./cpu_lu

# OpenACC Version
g++ -O3 -fopenacc -o lup_openacc lup_openacc.cpp
./lup_openacc

# Note: LUP decomposition is used for solving systems of linear equations
# and matrix inversion. Different implementations show varying performance
# characteristics based on matrix size and hardware capabilities.
