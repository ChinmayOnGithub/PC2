# ===== EXPLANATION =====
# LUP Decomposition Program
# This program performs LUP decomposition (matrix factorization)
# Implements CPU, CUDA, and OpenACC versions
# LUP decomposition is used for solving systems of linear equations
# and matrix inversion. Different implementations show varying performance
# characteristics based on matrix size and hardware capabilities.

# ===== EXECUTION COMMANDS =====
# GPU Version (CUDA)
# Compile the CUDA program
nvcc -o cuda_lu lup_cuda.cu

# Run the GPU version
./cuda_lu

# CPU Version
# Compile the C++ program
g++ -o cpu_lu lup_cpu.cpp

# Run the CPU version
./cpu_lu

# OpenACC Version
# Compile the OpenACC program
g++ -fopenacc -o lup_openacc lup_openacc.cpp

# Run the OpenACC version
./lup_openacc

# Note: LUP decomposition is used for solving systems of linear equations
# and matrix inversion. Different implementations show varying performance
# characteristics based on matrix size and hardware capabilities.
