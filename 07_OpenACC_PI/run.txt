# Pi Calculation Program
# This program calculates Pi using Monte Carlo method
# Implements both CPU and OpenACC versions

# OpenACC Version
# Compile the OpenACC program
g++ -fopenacc -o openACCPI openACC_PI.cpp

# Run the OpenACC version
./openACCPI

# CPU Version
# Compile the C++ program
g++ -o pi pi.cpp

# Run the CPU version
./pi

# Note: The program uses Monte Carlo method to estimate Pi
# OpenACC version demonstrates parallel computing capabilities
