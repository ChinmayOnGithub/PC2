# ===== EXPLANATION =====
# SYCL Pi Calculation Program
# This program calculates Pi using SYCL
# Demonstrates SYCL programming model for heterogeneous computing
# SYCL is a higher-level programming model for heterogeneous computing
# that can target different hardware platforms including CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs

# ===== EXECUTION COMMANDS =====
# SYCL Version
# Compile the SYCL program
g++ -o pi SYCL_PI.cpp -lOpenCL

# Run the SYCL version
./pi

# CPU Version
# Compile the C++ program
g++ -o pi_cpu pi.cpp

# Run the CPU version
./pi_cpu

# Note: SYCL is a higher-level programming model for heterogeneous computing
# that can target different hardware platforms including CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs
