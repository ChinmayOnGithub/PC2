# ===== EXPLANATION =====
# Matrix Multiplication Program
# This program performs matrix multiplication on CPU and GPU
# Demonstrates parallel computation capabilities of GPU
# The GPU version uses parallel processing to multiply matrices
# and typically shows significant speedup for large matrices

# ===== EXECUTION COMMANDS =====
# GPU Version (CUDA)
# Compile the CUDA program
nvcc -o matMulGPU matMul.cu

# Run the GPU version
./matMulGPU

# CPU Version
# Compile the C++ program
g++ -o matMulCPU matMul.cpp

# Run the CPU version
./matMulCPU

# Note: The GPU version uses parallel processing to multiply matrices
# and typically shows significant speedup for large matrices
