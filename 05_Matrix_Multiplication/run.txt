# ===== EXPLANATION =====
# Matrix Multiplication Program
# This program performs matrix multiplication on CPU and GPU
# Demonstrates parallel computation capabilities of GPU
# The GPU version uses parallel processing to multiply matrices
# and typically shows significant speedup for large matrices

# ===== EXECUTION COMMANDS =====
# GPU Version
nvcc -O3 -o matMulGPU matMul.cu
./matMulGPU

# CPU Version
g++ -O3 -o matMulCPU matMul.cpp
./matMulCPU

# Note: The GPU version uses parallel processing to multiply matrices
# and typically shows significant speedup for large matrices
