# Fractal Image Compression Program
# This program implements fractal image compression using CPU and SYCL
# Input image: Sandesh.jpeg
# Output images: output.png, output1.png

# CPU Version
# Compile the C++ program
g++ -o compress compression.cpp

# Run the CPU version
./compress

# SYCL Version
# Compile the SYCL program
g++ -o syclCompress syclCompress.cpp -lOpenCL

# Run the SYCL version
./syclCompress

# Note: Fractal compression is a lossy compression method for digital images
# based on fractals. The method is best suited for photographs of natural scenes
# and works by finding self-similar patterns in the image.
